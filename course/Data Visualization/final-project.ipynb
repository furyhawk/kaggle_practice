    "Note that the datasets that you see on the page will likely look different from what's shown in the screenshot above, since many new datasets are uploaded every day!  There are many different file types on Kaggle Datasets, including CSV files, but also more exotic file types such as JSON, SQLite, and BigQuery.  We'll be careful to select a dataset with at least one CSV file, since that is the file type we have been working with in this course.\n",
